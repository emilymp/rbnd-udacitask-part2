# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used "builder" in order to automate the creation of an HTML file that will display the List.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1...
  The UdaciList method to_html uses the HTMLMaker module to format the list into an HTML file with the information organized into tables.

  I created the ImageItem class to support images as a list item-type.
  
  
  
# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Too long-- I have been working on this over the course of several weeks. However, this is mostly because I have been busy and haven't had the time to put into it.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Figuring out how to use the builder gem-- I spent are really long time making test cases to help figure it out.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I created a feature to nicely format the lists into html tables because I figured the list would only be useful if you could easily see the information, and I also wanted to learn about automating markup languages. The second feature was support for images as item-types, because I thought it would be fun to display them on the html file.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Style/neatness, understanding bigger concepts like what actually happens when you raise/rescue an error, inputing data at the command line or on a form that adds it to a Udacilist
